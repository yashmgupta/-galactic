3D Spiral Galaxy Simulation
A 3D interactive simulation of a spiral galaxy built with Python, Streamlit, NumPy, and Plotly. This project allows users to visualize and explore a spiral galaxy by adjusting various parameters such as the number of stars, spiral arm tightness, galactic scale, rotation speed, and galactic height.

Introduction
As a bioinformatician with a passion for astronomy, I created this project to blend my love for coding with the wonders of the cosmos. Inspired by nights spent stargazing on terraces in India and continued exploration under the skies of Thailand, this simulation brings the beauty of spiral galaxies to your screen.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Adjust galaxy parameters in real-time using sliders.
Customizable Parameters:
Number of stars per arm
Number of core stars
Spiral openness (tightness of the spiral arms)
Galactic scale (size of the galaxy)
Rotation speed of the animation
Galactic height (thickness of the galaxy)
3D Animation: View the galaxy from different angles with an animated rotation.
Educational Content: Sidebar information about spiral galaxies and their components.
